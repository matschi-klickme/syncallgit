# syncallgit
Never forget to pull/push/commit again. The perfect start into your day!
Simple script to sync (pull, commit, push )  git repos.

If "~/.config/git_dirs" file exists,it will be used. Otherwise $PWD folder. 

## git_dirs file: 
One folder containing git repos per line pls. 

## Avoid annoying stuff: 

@untracked files: The ".gitignore" file is your friend!

@github: Switch to ssh-based pull/push and ssh-key auth to avoid annoying "please enter your account/pw"
